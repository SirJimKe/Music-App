Project Name: Music App

Author : Jimmy Mutuku

This is a simple music app that displays music lists, with their album images, title, and artists name. 
The user of the app can check details of the music title, add music to his favorites and remove from favorites. The user can also search music albums by typing the artists names or title name on the search bar. The user is also able to delete a song or add a new song. 

To run the project type in the project directory, you can run: `npm start` which runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to view it in your browser. The app uses a json-server to create a 
RESTful API for backend and make both a GET and a POST request to the json server.

The app is also available at [https://musiq-app.vercel.app/](https://musiq-app.vercel.app/)
